# Not Case Sensitive

by ModdedInstall2

This is a Python module for beginners that does one simple thing:
It adds a function, Print(), that does exactly the same thing as print().


Print("Yay!")

Yay! <br> Process finished with exit code 0

This is my first time making a readme, so please don't blame me for the sucky formatting. We all good? Yay! :-)
